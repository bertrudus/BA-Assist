# New System Requirements

We need a new system to handle things better. The current system is slow and users don't like it.

## Requirements

- The system should be fast and user-friendly
- It should handle lots of data
- Users should be able to log in and do stuff
- The system might need to integrate with other systems
- We need a dashboard that shows relevant information
- The system should use React and PostgreSQL
- It should be deployed on AWS using Docker containers
- Admin users and regular users should have different access levels and be able to manage their profiles and settings
- The system could potentially support mobile devices in the future
- Reports should be generated quickly etc.
- Performance should be good
- The system should be secure
